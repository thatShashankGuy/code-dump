<h1>Welcome to the Deep Dive 🤚🏼</h1>


<p>Deep-Dive is a personal project which i  am hoping can also help other to practice more code.</p>

<p>
The idea to get past the abstraction and learn the bare basics of code . I try to write everything in a very dumb down manner so anyone wanna try to understand can also understand what was done and why. I target absolute beginners or people like me who have still to trouble implementing complex and sometime even very simpe  Algortithms and data structires despite have writing code professionally for some time  and having fundament understanding of the programming due to layers of abstraction in new age development toolings and programming languages like what i use JavaScript . 🙂
</p>
<p>
We will go about basic DSA , famous Algorithms and problem solving techniques and some utility function. I dont have a plan yet 😅 Even I am learning all tihs and have started assuming I know nothing ! and will try not use any libraries or pre-existing code bases . YES THIS IS GONNA BE VERY VERBOSE AND BAREBONES!
</p>

<p>
I am writing this project in <b>C</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> with <b>python</b> transations in pipeline 
<p>
C because I wanna do some hands on C prograwmming but 
mostly because C is a mordern language with least abstraction and we are force to write everythhing 
</p>

<p>
Javscript cause I am a Javscript first developer its my native tongue when its come to programming (been a fullstack web/server dev for a while now 😶‍🌫️)
I am also at some point add python so people who are getting started and chose python as their first can aslo use this. ( as I started programming with Python . Despite C and C++ being in curiculum)
<p>

<p> In the end I will like to say when this goes public and someone shares or you stumble upon it all feedbacks are welcomed and open to contributions and i would be very happy if this helps anyone out . </p>
