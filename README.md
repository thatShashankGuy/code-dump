Starting with Data structures like linklist , Queues and stacks going to few complicated algorithm implementations and few utility tool.

The project do not meant to a showcase or guide as its mostly gonna be  unstructured code of the day type exercise . 

I will try to comment explaination along with code for revision or revisiting any problem
