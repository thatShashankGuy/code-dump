Hi welcome to roughwork

Little introductio I am shashank or @thatshashankguy and i have been coding for 4 years but i think i am not good i just write for companies with there tooling and stuff 

I wanna learn to write some awesome thhings just for me . Tried many times but i am lazy unorganised so i created letsgo 
I Will write code and push to git for tracking and aim to write and make a push daily so that i am in loop . I wanna readup on lots of things but i am not gonna be to
Ambitious and keep this vague . Random codes snippets, exercises , functions,Nothing revolutionary just some ROUGH WORK 

The project / directory is primary gonna be filled with some code .. Lots of Code actually . I have hard time lerning stuff 
so i decided to use this project to track my learnings .

What i am planning ? 
Nothing much .. Some DSA , in JS (my primary language ) bit of C or python based on how i am feeling on the day .

May be small utility functions or maybe a useful library . NO IDEA! AND DONT CARE I JUST WANNA WRITE SOME CODE FOR MYSELF 


GONNA BE VERY VERY RANDOM 
THANKS : )
